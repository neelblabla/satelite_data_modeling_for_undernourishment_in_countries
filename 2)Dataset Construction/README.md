Building of our dataset

Goal is the creation of a main dataset, combining all the individual sources.

The steps in this procedure are as follows:

1) create_country_time_base -> here we use the dataset on undernourishment as a base, as we want to predict this variable
2) create_combined_dataset -> here the final dataset is being created
